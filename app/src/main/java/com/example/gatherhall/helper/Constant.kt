<p>This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of the accompanying GatherHall Software (the &quot;Program&quot;). For the purposes of this Agreement, &quot;you&quot; means you, the end user as identified by your Apple user identification and you the licensee, and &quot;Licensor&quot; means Effortless Messaging LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>

<p>1. License Grant. Licensor hereby grants to you a revocable, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use copies of the Program on digital electronic devices associated with a single Apple user identification after purchase or authorized download from the Apple App Store according to the provisions contained herein. The Program includes, but is not limited to, communication between electronic devices via chats accomplished via downloadable software modules and downloadable applications. You are not permitted to lease, rent, distribute, or sublicense the Program or any rights therein. Further, no license is granted to you in the human readable code of the Program (&ldquo;source code&rdquo;). Except as provided below, this Agreement does not grant you any rights to patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, or any other rights in the Program. You agree that you have no right, power, or authority to make any modifications to or unauthorized copies of the Program.</p>

<p>2. Responsible Use. You acknowledge that your ability to monitor surroundings and react to such surroundings may be greatly reduced while using the Program and, accordingly, use of the Program is at your own risk. You shall not use the Program while operating a vehicle, walking, running, navigating stairs, or the like (&ldquo;Inherently Dangerous Circumstances&rdquo;). Use of the Program while engaged in Inherently Dangerous Circumstances shall be avoided by you. You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensor from and against liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) arising from any claims from anybody that result from or relate to your use of the Program during Inherently Dangerous Circumstances.</p>

<p>3. Collection and Use of Your Personal Information. Personal information is data that can be used to identify, geolocate, monitor electronic device use, or contact you. Licensor may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information. Licensor may process your personal information, with your consent, for compliance with Apple requirements or for compliance with a legal obligation to which Licensor is subject. Licensor also uses personal information to help create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve Licensor&rsquo;s products, services, content and advertising. Licensor may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material. Licensor may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Licensor&rsquo;s Program, related products, services, and customer communications.</p>

<p>Licensor also collects data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. Licensor may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. Licensor may collect non-personally identifying information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where Program is used so that Licensor can better understand your behavior and improve Licensor&rsquo;s Program, and related products, services, and advertising. You further agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information - including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals - that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of Program updates, product support, and other services (if any) to you related to the Program. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its Program, products, or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>

<p>4. Permission to Disclose Your Use and Terminate Your License for Illegal Activity. If Licensor determines that you are uploading potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material, then Licensor shall have the right to notify Apple, to notify appropriate legal authorities, and to terminate the license and revoke your ability to use the program with any and all electronic devices associated with your Apple user identification.</p>

<p>5. No Assignment; No Transfer. You agree not to transfer or assign the Program and/or this Agreement to another party without the prior written consent of Licensor. Consent shall be at Licensor&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion. If such consent is given and you transfer or assign the Program and/or this Agreement, then you must at the same time either transfer any copies of the Program to the same party or destroy or return to Licensor any such materials not transferred. Except as set forth above, you may not transfer or assign the Program or rights under this Agreement. For example, Licensor may authorize the transfer of your license to another Apple user identification of a family member or heir in the event of your death or incapacity if so requested.</p>

<p>Licensor may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent.</p>

<p>6. No Liability for Termination or Suspension of Program by Apple. In the event that Apple, should remove the Program from the Apple App store, temporarily or otherwise, or in the event that Apple should suspend operation of the Program, Licensor shall have no obligation to refund payments by you. Nor shall Licensor be liable for any damages arising from such disruptions.</p>

<p>7. No Modification; No Reverse Engineering. You agree not to modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Program or assist someone in performing such prohibited acts.</p>

<p>8. You Agree not to use Licensor&rsquo;s Branding.

Fair use of Licensor&rsquo;s Branding IP for purposes of leaving reviews only is allowed.</p>

<p>9. Program is not for Use for Business nor Contracting. As with all electronic communications, outages and/or disruptions are possible due to software bugs, electronic device failure, lack of signal (or signal interference) in your location or in the location of the party to whom communications are sent, or due to cyber attack by third parties. The Program is for personal use only. As such Licensor shall not be liable for any lost business revenue or loss of business opportunity due to failure to contract or communicate with third parties.</p>

<p>10. Import/Export Restrictions. You agree not to import or export the Program (or any copies thereof) or any products utilizing the Program in violation of any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or the country to which you have imported or exported. You agree to indemnify Licensor from liability if you violate any such laws or regulations.</p>

<p>11. Title. This is a license agreement, and not an agreement for sale.

You agree that you have no title in any such property. Licensor retains all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement.</p>

<p>12. Term and Termination. This license will expire when the Program has been removed from the Apple store or when your Apple identification is abandoned, expires, or is revoked by Apple.</p>

<p>You may terminate this license at any time by deleting the Program from all of your electronic devices and not downloading further copies from the Apple store in connection with the same Apple user identification used to originally purchase the Program. Your license for the Program will also terminate immediately if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Because Licensor would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that the Licensor shall be entitled, without bond or other security or proof of damages, to take such an action as may be required, including seeking an injunction and other equitable remedies, in addition to any other remedies available under the applicable law.</p>

<p>13. Governing Law.

<p>14. No Warranties.

LICENSOR ALSO MAKES NO WARRANTIES RELATING TO GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY BE RECOMMENDED IN PERSONAL REPORTS. THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING SOURCE CODE) IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ABOVE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD. MOREOVER, IN NO EVENT WILL WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY LAW, IF ANY, APPLY UNLESS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO APPLY BY STATUTE NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR EXCLUSION BY CONTRACT. NO DEALER, AGENT, OR EMPLOYEE OF LICENSOR IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS, EXTENSIONS, OR ADDITIONS TO THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH YOU.</p>

<p>15. Limitation of Remedies. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (WHETHER OR NOT DUE TO ANY DEFECTS THEREIN). IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATING TO GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY BE RECOMMENDED IN PERSONAL REPORTS. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES EVEN IF LICENSOR SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORSEEABLE, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR&#39;S LIABILITY EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID BY YOUR COMPANY FOR THE PRGORAM.</p>

<p>Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Licensor shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<p>16. Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensor from and against liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) arising from any claims from anybody that result from or relate to your use, reproduction, or distribution of the Program.</p>

<p>17. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity, legality, and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<p>18. Entire Agreement. You further agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and Licensor which supersedes all proposals or prior agreements, oral or written, and all other communications between you and Licensor relating to the subject matter of this agreement.
